# Frequenz Client Base Library Release Notes

## Summary

<!-- Here goes a general summary of what this release is about -->

## Upgrading

- `GrpcStreamBroadcaster` now takes a `AsyncIterable` instead of a `AsyncIterator` as the `stream_method`. This is to match the type of streaming methods generated by `grpc`, so no conversion to an `AsyncIterator` is needed.

## New Features

<!-- Here goes the main new features and examples or instructions on how to use them -->

## Bug Fixes

<!-- Here goes notable bug fixes that are worth a special mention or explanation -->
