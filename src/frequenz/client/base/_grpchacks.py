"""Hacks to deal with multiple grpc libraries.

This module conditionally imports symbols from the `grpclib` and `grpcio` libraries,
assigning them a new name.

for `grpclib`:

- `GrpclibError` for `grpclib.GRPCError`
- `GrpclibChannel` for `grpclib.client.Channel`

For `grpcio`:

- `GrpcioError` for `grpc.aio.AioRpcError`
- `GrpcioChannel` for `grpc.aio.Channel`
- `GrpcioSslChannelCredentials` for `grpc.ssl_channel_credentials`
- `grpcio_insecure_channel` for `grpc.aio.insecure_channel`
- `grpcio_secure_channel` for `grpc.aio.secure_channel`

If the libraries are not installed, the module defines dummy symbols with the same names
to avoid import errors.

This way exceptions code can be written to work with both libraries assuming both are
aviailable, and the correct symbols will be imported at runtime.
